#+TITLE: ~denote-roam~

A GNU Emacs package to bridge [[https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote][denote]] and [[https://www.orgroam.com/][org-roam]] for format consistent and atomic note taking.

* Philosophy
This is a personal workflow developed through discovery. I found that denote is good at making notes, but org-roam is better at linking them. Using them in tandem allows for the most amount of features. This package facilitates this workflow.

I discovered this workflow during a chem lecture because I was bored, but it's been really helpful for my writing process for school and self study.

* Installation/Configuration
This is a personal project, so you will need to install it from version control e.g. my GitHub repository.

** ~use-package~ — Recommended route
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package denote-roam
    :vc (:url "https://github.com/BardofSprites/denote-roam"
         :rev newest)
    :after (denote org-roam)
    :bind
    ("C-c n i" . denote-roam-insert-or-create-node)  ; node insert
    ("C-c n o" . denote-roam-find-or-create-node)    ; node open
    :custom
    ;; default is nil to include denote-journal entries in org-roam database
    (denote-roam-include-journal nil)
    (denote-roam-directory "~/Notes")
    :config
    (denote-roam-mode t))
#+end_src

** Manual Install
Install all the dependencies for org-roam and denote. Then clone the repo:

#+begin_src
  git clone https://github.com/BardofSprites/denote-roam.git
#+end_src

Finally, add the package to your load path in your init.el or somewhere:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/denote-roam")
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/dependencies")
#+end_src
